## Professional Experience 
 
 1. Deep learning Researcher at [NimbleBox.ai](https://www.nimblebox.ai/) - Oct 2020 -> Present
 2. Deep Learning Engineer at [Maviox Solutions](https://www.mavoix.in/) - May 2020 -> Aug 2020

## Projects 

1. **Open Source Contributor at [Mlpack](https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/mlpack)**
- A fast and modern Machine learning/Deep Learning library written in C++ that also supports binding for the most popular languages such as R, Python Julia, etc.

2. **[Robert Bot, ChatBot](https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/robert_bot)**
- Robert is a ChatBot trained on the Cornell movie dialogue Dataset and is able to converse meaningful short sentences with the user.
- Written in Python with PyTorch and it uses a GRU unit to construct a Seq2Seq architecture with Attention mechanism and uses teacher forcing to train and uses greedy search algorithm to find the best reply to the supplied sentence.

3. **[Slack Helper Bot](https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/obj_detection)**
- This is a slack bot that can be integrated in any slack workspace and when given access to cameras can help the members find their lost objects by returning an image of the object the user may have lost.
- Written in Python and uses mmdetection for the object detection backbone and the python slack API to control the slack bot.

4. **[Object Detector](https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/object_detection)**
- Able to detect a huge variety of objects in any kind of Image and Videos.
- Written in Python and used PyTorch and single shot detector(SSD-300).

5. **[Modak vs Other Sweets](https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/image_classification)**
- This model is able to classify or differentiate Modak(a type of Indian sweet) from any other kind of Indian sweet.
- Used Python And PyTorch with a custom Convolutional Neural Network.
